# Runs hourly to publish articles whose Publication Date has arrived.
# This handles future-dated articles: you can tick post_to_wordpress
# and set a future date — the script will publish when the date comes.
# Also triggered by Zapier when post_to_wordpress is ticked (for same-day),
# or manually via GitHub Actions UI.
